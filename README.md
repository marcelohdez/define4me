# Define4Me

A graphical Java application which finds the definition of words in a text file using 
the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) in order to make vocabulary 
word homework less tedious, among other things.

## Prerequisites
* The newest [JDK](https://adoptium.net/) is recommended, while the minimum should
be stated in the description of the release you are trying to run.
* A ```.txt``` file with each word in a new line is required, as Define4Me will read 
each line as a new "word", this allows you to have things such as "chat room" which 
has a space in between the two words and Define4Me will still attempt to find a
definition for it.
